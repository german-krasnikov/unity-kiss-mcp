"""TDD tests for send-path cooldown gate (Phase 2.1 of connection-stability fix).

Verifies:
- E1: burst-prevention — 3 sends in <1s → only 1 reconnect, 2 raise ConnectionError
- E2: allows-after-backoff — second reconnect OK once cooldown expires
- E3: callback-no-cascade — reconnect callback raises → state stays CONNECTED
- E4: 30s-dedup — _on_reconnect closure deduplication
- E5: FAILED-state-cooldown — FAILED + fresh cooldown → ConnectionError without reconnect
